# Smash it with Courage!

#### Description
This is a simple game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The game is part of a tutorial I've followed to learn Javascript, so the game could have some issues now but I'll try to improve it soon.

#### Acknowledgement
The project was built using a Gulp boilerplate created by **Chris Ferdinandi**. His Github profile is [cferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi) so you can find the project in the following link: [gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gulp-boilerplate).
There you can find all the documentation related to the boilerplate project and how you can start using it for your web development.
***Thanks, Chris!***
